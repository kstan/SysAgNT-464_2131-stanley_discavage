Description
============

SysAgNT is a Windows Profiler designed as an agent that can be placed on a computer and can call back
to a centralized server where the data collected can be organized. 

The information it collects includes:

applications/services on the system
applications/services in use
times system is typically on
times system is in use
times system is idle
times system is logged into
user logged into system

All this information is organized so that a profile of the system can be created to help system administrators
and IT professionals to better know when to run patches, secure the system and recognize suspicious activity.



Installation
============

Run Powershell as Administrator (right click, run as administrator)

Type following command in Powershell:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

If not run as administrator, there will be an error.
