SysAgNT is a Windows Profiler.  It works as a PowerShell script that is run from a domain controller and gathers information from computers every hour.  The information it collects includes the name of the computer, the type of operating system, applications/services as well as what user is using on the system. All this information is organized so that a profile of the system can be created to help system administrators and IT professionals to better know when to run patches, secure the system and recognize suspicious activity.
